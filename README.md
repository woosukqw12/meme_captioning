Image-to-Text Model FineTuning for Meme Generation


To train and test our codes on your device, you must download the "Oxford_HIC" dataset first.
You can download it here https://github.com/runjiali-rl/Oxford_HIC/tree/master/data.

Here's an sample of this dataset below.

We trained the CLIP-based model to generate humor caption for the given image like in Oxford-HIC dataset.

We fully trained the parameters of pre-trained CLIP model with Cross-Entropy Loss between the generated caption and the humor caption from the Oxford-HIC dataset.
Here are some examples of generated humor caption from our CLIP-based Finetuned model.
